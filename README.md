# Primality-Tests
This code is my Final Project of the course √Ålgebra and Cryptography on EMAp-FGV in 2021.1.

The codes are about primality tests (like Fermat test, Miller-Rabin test and Sieve of Eratosthenes) and a prime generator, that prints the prime factor decomposition too with Pollard's rho algorithm.
The purpose of this code is to generate primes to be implemented on systems based on RSA Cryptography.

Any doubt, problem or suggestions can be sent to me by my e-mail (davi_ashercb@gmail.com).
